intro sentence

tease sparsity thing

## Inequality indices

Gini ok, geometric intuition, has some nice properties

basically unmotivated

## Aggregating utility functions

capture the diminishing-returns part perfectly

misses other downsides of inequality

### Aside: the veil of ignorance

infinite risk-aversion, Harsanyi

## Picking a utility function

indifference to monetary units
practical concern, not an axiom
--> linear induces affine
(log: --> shift)
(power: --> linear)
--> do some math
--> Atkinson!
--> also GE index

## Aggregation

sketch it out
do the math if necessary

## Impossible utility functions

GE(2) seems fine, right?
upside down quadratic utility function
whoops!

## Inequality and sparsity

Hoyer ratio

whatever the thing I told Nora was about integrating some other thing to get Hoyer ratio

arggggh where are the notessss

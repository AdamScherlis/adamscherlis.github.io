There are a few online communities of hobbyist mathematicians that I absolutely adore. This post is about a cluster of them with some fun secret connections:

* Googology
* Busy Beavers
* Conway's Game of Life
* Small Diophantine equations
* Tilings

Some recurring math topics that I also think are cool:

* Computability
* Proof verification
* Reverse mathematics
* Ordinal and cardinal infinities

## Busy Beavers

### BB(5)

### Have we busied our last beaver?

## The Game of Life

## Diophantine equations

As you have no doubt heard by now,

$$
\begin{align}
2025 &= 1^3 + 2^3 + 3^3 + 4^3 + 5^3 + 6^3 + 7^3 + 8^3 + 9^3\\
&= (1+2+3+4+5+6+7+8+9)^2
\end{align}
$$

thanks to [Nicomachus's theorem](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Squared_triangular_number).

In other words, 2025 is the square of the 9th triangle number.

But 9 is *also* the square of a triangle number!

$$
\begin{align}
9 &= 1^3 + 2^3\\
&= (1+2)^2
\end{align}
$$

Defining some notation for triangle and square numbers,

$$
\begin{align}
\triangle n &:= \frac{n(n+1)}2\\ 
\square n &:= n^2
\end{align}
$$

we can summarize things thus:

$$2025 = \square \triangle \square \triangle 2.$$

This is fairly benign magic; dabblers in the dark arts may wish to try \(\triangle\square\triangle\triangle 2\) instead.

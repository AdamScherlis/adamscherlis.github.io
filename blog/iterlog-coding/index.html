<h2>Floats with just the sign bits</h2>
<p>I've created a new format for encoding real numbers on computers. I'm proud of it! Let's dive in.</p>
<h2>Real number formats</h2>
<p>We have some real value <script type="math/tex">x\in\mathbb R</script>. Could be positive or negative or zero, large or small. How can we store it in a bitstring?</p>
<p>Fixed-point numbers have one bit for the sign of <script type="math/tex">x</script> (positive or negative) and <script type="math/tex">n-1</script> bits for its absolute value <script type="math/tex">|x|</script>, in binary, with an implied decimal point in some fixed location. (They actually usually use two's-complement instead of representing <script type="math/tex">|x|</script> directly, but let's not get into that right now.)</p>
<p>Floating-point numbers basically use scientific notation. One bit for the sign of <script type="math/tex">x</script> (positive or negative), some bits for an integer exponent, and some more for the significand. This is more flexible because it maintains constant <em>relative</em> precision instead of <em>absolute</em> precision. Note that the exponent is the floor of the logarithm of the absolute value, <script type="math/tex">\lfloor\log |x|\rfloor</script>, and the significand accounts for the fractional part (mantissa): <script type="math/tex">\exp(\log |x| - \lfloor \log |x| \rfloor)</script>. (I'm using <script type="math/tex">\log(a)</script> and <script type="math/tex">\exp(a)</script> to mean <script type="math/tex">\log_2(a)</script> and <script type="math/tex">2^a</script>, or <script type="math/tex">\log_b(a)</script> and <script type="math/tex">b^a</script> if you want to generalize to an arbitrary base.)</p>
<p><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Logarithmic_number_system">Logarithmic number systems</a> are similar, but a bit more elegant: instead of separating the integer part of the logarithm from the fractional part and encoding them separately, it's just a direct fixed-point representation of <script type="math/tex">\log |x|</script> and a separate sign bit for <script type="math/tex">x</script>.</p>
<p>At this point things are getting kind of interesting: we have a sign bit for <script type="math/tex">x</script> and another (inside the fixed-point representation) for <script type="math/tex">\log |x|</script>. This second sign bit tells us whether the number is large (<script type="math/tex">x\ge1</script> or <script type="math/tex">x\le -1</script>) or small (<script type="math/tex">-1 < x < 1</script>).</p>
<p><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Symmetric_level-index_arithmetic">Symmetric level-index</a> representations go farther, and let you represent truly enormous numbers: they encode the number of times you need to take a logarithm to make <script type="math/tex">x</script> be a reasonable size, as well as what's left over after the final logarithm. Like logarithmic number systems, they have two sign bits, one for <script type="math/tex">x</script> and one for its <em>first</em> logarithm.</p>
<p>But we can do better.</p>
<h2>Introducing the iterated-log format</h2>
<p>Let's describe <script type="math/tex">x</script>, a little at a time.</p>
<p>First: is it positive or negative? That's determined by the sign <script type="math/tex">s_0 = \text{sgn}\, x</script>, counting zero as positive. What's left over is the absolute value <script type="math/tex">|x|</script>.</p>
<p>Then: is it large in magnitude or small? Take <script type="math/tex">x_1 = \log |x|</script> and find its sign, <script type="math/tex">s_1 = \text{sgn}\, x_1</script>. The information left over is <script type="math/tex">|x_1|</script>.</p>
<p>Then: is it very large-or-small, like -10,000 and +0.0001, or just moderately large-or-small, like 1.3 or -0.8? This is determined by <script type="math/tex">s_2 = \text{sgn}\, x_2</script>, where <script type="math/tex">x_2 = \log |x_1|</script>. (To elaborate a bit: we're asking about whether <script type="math/tex">x_1 = \log |x|</script> is large in magnitude, because very large-or-small numbers have very positive-or-negative logs, i.e. large ones.)</p>
<p>You can see where we go from here. We define <script type="math/tex">x_3 = \log |x_2|</script> and take its sign <script type="math/tex">s_3</script>. At this point things are getting a bit abstract, but we can still interpret this sign: positive values indicate that <script type="math/tex">x</script> is extremely large, extremely small, or very close to <script type="math/tex">\pm 1</script>; negative values indicate that it's somewhere in between.</p>
<p>Okay, so what's our proposed format? It's essentially just:</p>
<p>
<script type="math/tex; mode=display">s_0s_1s_2s_3\cdots</script>
</p>
<p>So a small positive number begins <script type="math/tex">(+-\ldots)</script>, a large negative one begins <script type="math/tex">(-+\ldots)</script>, etc.</p>
<p>This might not seem like enough information to reconstruct the number, but it is: every additional sign restricts the range of possible values, and any level of precision for a given number can be achieved with enough signs.</p>
<h2>Gray code and lexicographic ordering</h2>
<p>Let's stop at three signs' worth of precision for now and see what we have, in order:</p>
<pre><code>-++
-+-
---
--+
+-+
+--
++-
+++
</code></pre>
<p>Well, that's funny! It's a <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gray_code">Gray code</a>. Cute, but maybe not the most practical.</p>
<p>Let's convert our signs to bits, moving to a standard lexicographic ordering in the process. The rules for this are straightforward:</p>
<ul>
<li>For the first bit, <script type="math/tex">1</script> means positive and <script type="math/tex">0</script> means negative.</li>
<li>Every negative sign flips the encoding for subsequent bits</li>
</ul>
<h2>Rounding and padding</h2>
<p>So far, a finite string of sign bits specifies an interval, not a single value.</p>
<p>To fix a well-defined value for every bitstring and handle some annoying fencepost issues, let's specify that:</p>
<ul>
<li>An empty sequence of signs represents zero</li>
<li>If the sign sequence <script type="math/tex">S</script> represents <script type="math/tex">x</script>, then <script type="math/tex">+S</script> represents <script type="math/tex">2^x</script>...</li>
<li>...and <script type="math/tex">-S</script> represents <script type="math/tex">-2^x</script>
</li>
<li>After converting signs to bits, an extra <script type="math/tex">1</script> is appended, followed by an arbitrary number of zeroes for padding</li>
<li>The all-zero bitstring represents <code>NaN</code></li>
</ul>
<p>This gives us the following values for sequences of up to two signs:</p>
<pre><code>-+ [0 0 1] -2
-  [0 1 0] -1
-- [0 1 1] -0.5
   [1 0 0] 0
+- [1 0 1] 0.5
+  [1 1 0] 1
++ [1 1 1] 2
</code></pre>
<p>Note that the trailing <script type="math/tex">1000\ldots</script> that we append has a nice semantic interpretation; with infinitely many zeroes appended, it decodes to </p>
<p>
<script type="math/tex; mode=display">\pm-++\ldots = \pm 2^{-\infty} = 0</script>
</p>
<p>which is what we want an empty sequence to represent anyway.</p>
<p>So an alternative prescription, if you like mathematical elegance over efficiency, is to append an infinite string of zeroes and take the limit.</p>
<!-- 
Similarly, \(000\ldots\) in principle represents \(-\infty\), although the lack of a finite-length encoding for \(111\ldots = \infty\) makes this somewhat less useful.

And in addition to \(1000\ldots = +0\), there's also \(0111\ldots = -0\), so we have the usual fencepost ambiguity of infinite decimals. -->

<h2>Code</h2>
<p>The prototype implementation is in a notebook <a href="https://github.com/AdamScherlis/notebooks-python/blob/main/math/iterlog_coding.ipynb">here</a>, warts and all. There's also some bonus math which I might explain in a later post.</p>
<h2>Every 7-bit number</h2>
<p>I know 7 is a weird bit depth, but it's just enough to show off the killer features of this format:</p>
<ul>
<li>Lexicographic ordering</li>
<li>Wide range of values</li>
<li>Symmetric across zero</li>
<li>Any value representable in <script type="math/tex">n</script> bits is representable in <script type="math/tex">n+1</script> bits</li>
<li>Numbers too large to represent in any float format</li>
<li>Numbers too small to represent in any float format</li>
<li>Numbers extremely close to 1</li>
<li>Exciting fractally-nonuniform spacing of values</li>
<li>Wildly unpredictable precision</li>
<li>etc.</li>
</ul>
